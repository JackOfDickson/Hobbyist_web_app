Hello user! Welcome to my project!
This is a application that uses python3, posegresSQL and flask which runs a webpage on a browser and manages members lessons and bookings.

How to get it running!
Step 1 - set up a database so run the following command in your terminal:
createdb hobbyist
Step 2 - navigate to the hobbyist file location and seed the data by running the console.py by run the following command:
python3 console.py
Step 3 - Run the application by inputting into the console (need to be in the same hobbyist file as before):
flask run
Step 4 - Open your browser (I would recommend chrome) and enter the address of the local host port (If unsure look at your terminal look at the line "Running on" and copy and paste the url into the browser)
If you need to close the app you can press control and c to stop the webpage from running.

Navigating the website!
